                CustomList<T> - Operator Override
    Definition
Used to subtract one CustomList<T> from another, this is done through removing each value of the second array from the first if it exists.
  
public static CustomList<T> operator -(CustomList<T> baseList, CustomList<T> subtraction)
  
    Returns
CustomList<t>
Returns a custom list generated by subtracting the second array from the first.
  
    Implements
CustomList<T>.Remove(T)
  
    Examples


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
    
        //Creates lists of ints
        CustomList<int> list = new CustomList<int>();
        CustomList<int> list2 = new CustomList<int>();
        CustomList<int> list3;
  
        //Adds parts to first list
        list.Add(6);
        list.Add(8);
        list.Add(9);
        list.Add(7);
            
        //Adds parts to second list
        list2.Add(5);
        list2.Add(8);
        list2.Add(9);
        list2.Add(3);

        //Subtracts list2 from list and stores it in the currently null list 3
        list3 = list - list2;
            
        //Outputs list3 to console as a string
        Console.WriteLine(list3.ToString());
    }
}

//Example code output: 67

    Remarks
The Remove method implemented within the - operator only removes the first instance of a given number. Therefore, the same number will only be removed from the first list more than once if it occurs more than once within the second list.

This method performs a linear search; therefore, this method is an O(n) operation, where n is Count.
